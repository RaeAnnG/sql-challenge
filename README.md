Module 9 SQL Challenge
-
Research project about people whom the company employed during the 1980s and 1990s. All that remains of the employee database from that period are six CSV files.
- 
Created the tables to hold the data from the CSV files, imported the CSV files into a SQL database, and then answered questions about the data to perform data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis.
- 
Created an ERD in order to create the schema - the ERD is shown in the following files
-
M9_SQL_ERD_Image - Powerpoint file - screen shot of ERD
M9_SQL_ERD_PDF - PDF of REDtables
M9_SQL_ERD_PNG - image of ERD flow chart
M9_SQL_ERD_Schema - text file of ERD table details

Exported ERD to create schema to create and alter the tables with the primary and foreign keys to set up the table relationships
-
M9SQL_Data_Schema - SQL file with the schema to create and alter the tables

Imported the CSV files into the tables in the following order
-
departments
salaries
titles
employees
dept_emp
dept_manager

Created the queries to complete the data analysis
-
M9SQL_Data_Analysis_Queries - SQL file with the queries
